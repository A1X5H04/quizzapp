# Quizzapp
### This is a react solo project

This Quiz Game is entirely made in ⚛️ react with a clean and minimal look, you may find my figma file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ZOucYaCmahCof1MxNCv5yf/Quizzapp?node-id=0%3A1&t=MVstHvwWEe2n5qDr-1).


## TODO LIST
### Issues to resolve

- [ ] To disable or hide the result div when there is remaining question to
   select, instead show how many questions are remaining to select
 - [ ] To fix the flashing `<Woohoo />` screen when the `<Game />` component is rendered
 
### Features to implement

- [ ] **High score and time**: To implement high score feature, which will calculate your high score on certain factors like, the time elapsed, the difficulty level, the correct question attempted, etc.
- [ ] **Anti Cheat**: To implement anti cheat feature to prevent cheating, this may achieve by refreshing the questions or make user to 'force-stay' on the current tab when the user try to switch tabs or windows, also pop up a notification saying 'No cheating allowed' some thing like that..
- [ ] **Rounds**:  To implement round feature, every round will be increase the time speed with `100ms`, this will be best implemented with the high score
- [ ] **Background**: To implement background feature (mostly for UI), which will change on every categories selected with UI
